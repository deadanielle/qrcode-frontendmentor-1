## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

When I first viewed the challenge, I was not able to figure out and thought it was complicated. Then I took time to understand the layout and design the qr code component card. Since I was familiar with flexbox the alignment and positioning of the card was easy. I also understood how to manipulate spacing with the help of padding. I realised that noting and painting a mental picture in the head before you start the work will save time and effort.

### Continued development
 On doing this project, I realised that I am able to replicate to a good extent, but I am yet to learn how to minimize code redundancy and reduce the number of lines. I should work on it and become efficient. For example, to add the background color, first I tried using the body , but since it didnt reflect any change , I had to add another div which enclosed the card to give the bg color.
